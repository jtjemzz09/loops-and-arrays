// This code initializes an empty array called reverseNumbers to store the reversed elements of another array called countdown.
const reverseNumbers=[]
const countdown=[1,3,5,7,9,11]
// It then loops through the elements in the countdown array in reverse order using a for loop.
for( let i=countdown.length-1; i>=0; i--){
// For each iteration, it takes the current element of the countdown array (starting from the last element) and pushes it into the reverseNumbers array using the push() method.
   reverseNumbers.push(countdown[i]);
}
// Finally, the code logs the contents of the reverseNumbers array to the console, which should now contain the elements of countdown in reverse order.
console.log(reverseNumbers)
